# car-project
Simple web-app without styling. With frontend and backend (db: mongoDB atlas)

Tech-stack: JS, React, MobX, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JSON, (HTML, CSS)

STEPS:
1. Clone it.
2. Initial "npm install" in both directories.
3. Backend: npm run dev.
4. Frontend: npm start.

This simple web-app doesn't have stylings, but instead it connects to server, 
which connects to mongoDB. All data is stored in noSQL database.
State manager in this project is MobX.

Purpose of this project was to show my expertise with MobX, class components, life-cycle methods, creating noSQL DB,
MongoDB, creating REST API, fetching objects from DB.
